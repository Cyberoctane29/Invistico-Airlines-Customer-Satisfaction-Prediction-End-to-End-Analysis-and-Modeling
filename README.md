# Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-End-to-End-Analysis-and-Modeling
 This project presents an end-to-end analysis and modeling workflow aimed at predicting airline customer satisfaction based on survey data from 129,880 passengers. It involves building and evaluating multiple classification models, including Binomial Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to identify key factors influencing customer satisfaction and predict future outcomes. The project covers data importing, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and feature importance analysis â€” providing a comprehensive, industry-relevant machine learning pipeline for customer satisfaction prediction.
